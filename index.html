        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML elements build the structure and framework of a webpage- like the frame of a house!</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The head element is a container for metadeta. Meta elements contain information about the page that is used by the browser. The user won't see information in the head or meta elements.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>HTML elements inside the body element determine the formatting of the webpage.</li>
          <li>Elements nested inside other elements are called child elements. The element that holds the children is the parent element.</li>
          <li>In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage. Semantic HTML is important for a wide variety of users, developers, and the browser!</li>
          <li>The alt text is important for screen readers and can drive better search engine rankings.</li>
          <li>Headings should scale from H1 down toward H6. H1 text should only appear once on each page!</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
          <li>Inline CSS and internal style sheets are acceptable under certain conditions, but the most common way to style a webpage is by using an external style sheet</li>
          <li>An external style sheet can be linked in the head element of the HTML file</li>
          <li>Padding adds space around content inside an element, margins add space around the outside of an element</li>

        <ul>
          <li>A branch is a copy or a version of the code that can be worked on independently in isolation so development changes do not disrupt other team members who are also working on the code and testing their solutions.</li>
          <li>Use Git in your local development environment to enable version control.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>code .: opens VS code </li>
          <li>cd directory-name: changes the current directory to the named directory</li>
          <li>git add -A: The add command adds modifications in the current working branch to the staging area. The -A flag indicates that we want to add all changes.</li>

          <li>A function defines a block of code that performs a specific task by giving it a unique name. Creating a function will not execute the function! You have to call it.</li>
