# Prework Study Guide Webpage for Bootcamp Students

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created to study and review some of the key takeaways from the HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git learning sections of the Bootcamp's Prework Module. This resource was intended to reinforce those early learnings. It gives the intended end user, bootcamp students, the opportunity to swiftly review material as opposed to trying to sort back through the entire module to remember what they'd learned. 

### Learning 
Building this resource required working with new languages and systems. In the future, I expect to become more familiar and comfortable with each of these. This project served as an introduction to HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. 

## Installation

## Usage

The webpage is divided into four distinct study sections corresponding to the four learning topics: HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. Opening the DevTools console in Chrome will allow the user to see JavaScript running. You can open DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
